# EcoExchange

 EcoExchange is a revolutionary recycling-based commerce platform that aims to promote sustainability and reduce waste by enabling individuals and businesses to buy and sell recycled products.The platform will offer a one-stop-shop for all recycled products, ranging from clothing and furniture to electronics and building materials.The main goal of EcoExchange is to create a circular economy where waste is minimised, and materials are kept in use for as long as possible.The platform will achieve this by connecting buyers and sellers of recycled products in a user-friendly and secure online marketplace.EcoExchange will operate on a commission-based model, where sellers will be charged a small fee for listing their products on the platform.Buyers, on the other hand, will have access to a wide range of high-quality, affordable recycled products that are good for the environment and good for their wallets.
