### Project Description
EcoExchange is a revolutionary recycling-based commerce platform that aims to promote sustainability and reduce waste by enabling individuals and businesses to buy and sell recycled products. The platform will offer a one-stop-shop for all recycled products, ranging from clothing and furniture to electronics and building materials.
The main goal of EcoExchange is to create a circular economy where waste is minimised, and materials are kept in use for as long as possible. The platform will achieve this by connecting buyers and sellers of recycled products in a user-friendly and secure online marketplace.EcoExchange will operate on a commission-based model, where sellers will be charged a small fee for listing their products on the platform. Buyers, on the other hand, will have access to a wide range of high-quality, affordable recycled products that are good for the environment and good for their wallets.
